<h1> The Worst Day of My Life</h1>
<p> I remember the sad day my favorite <a href="https://www.Wikipedia.org/Animal-Crossing/"> Animal Crossing </a>  villager(Shep) moved out. It was sometime between 2014~2015, and  I was visiting my friend Evan's <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Wi-Fi_Connection"> town</a>.
  
  As soon as I left the train station, I saw a "sign", as (insert bad analogy) would say.
