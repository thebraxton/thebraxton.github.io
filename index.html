<body> Through time, the computer has gotten more and more complex and B I G G E R . <br>
</br> The first computers were very simple, and weren't used for many of the things we use today. 
Originally, most computers were used for a great variety of things, including but definitely limited to:
sales.
This primitive computer, being produced mostly in 1979 by Televideo, has mostly been completely abandoned from
being TOO OLD. Here is an example, of a Televideo TS802:

</br>The next evolution of the computer is the revolutionary(yeah right) operating system, MS-DOS. For most,DOS is what comes to mind when thinking of old OS'.

 After DOS, Microsoft Windows was created. This made it easier to do more than make files that type vulgar into the console(no joke, dos was pretty much just that).
The first Windows was Windows 3.0.After this, more 3.0 updates, putting one more number into the decimal, making it Windows 3.`1.<br>


</br> <br>Windows 95 and 98 were pretty definitive of all previous Windows operating systems(As in,before Windows 7, otherwise known as dinosaur times. ;) ).</br>
